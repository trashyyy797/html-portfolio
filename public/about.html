<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Shivani Shahi — a Computer Science Engineering student with a curious mind and a heart set on exploring the world beyond boundaries.<br />
   I’m someone who learns not just with books, but with stories, questions, and connections.<br />
    I believe understanding something deeply is more powerful than just knowing it.</p>

<p>As a student, I’m sincere, observant, and always looking for the “why” behind things.<br/>
   I love learning through analogies and finding patterns between everyday life and complex concepts.<br />
    When I’m not studying, you’ll probably find me journaling, reflecting, or exploring something new — be it a skill, a topic, or just a random idea.</p>

<p>I’m not afraid to question norms or take unconventional routes—because for me, growth comes from exploration, not comfort. <br />
  I value self-awareness, global learning, and meaningful impact.<br/>
  What keeps me motivated? The belief that I’m not meant to follow the crowd — I’m meant to create my own path.
